- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Rhoades.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, software engineering, and data science/visualization.
- 🌱 I'm currently completing a Udemy course that reinforces my front-end web development skills before extending those skills into back-end proficiency with languages such as SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that empower users and community stakeholders.
- 📫 You can reach me at rhoadesdaniel22@gmail.com.
